                        Cybernetics is a trans-disciplinary approach for exploring regulatory systems - their structures, constraints and possibilities. In other words, it is the scientific study of how humans, animals and machines control and communicate with each other. Its focus is on the processing of information and reaction to the information by a system and the changes that can be made to better accomplish these tasks. The relevance of Cybernetics extends across mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive and social systems.</p></div>
